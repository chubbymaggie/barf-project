BARF Project
============

So far the *BARF Project* is composed of the following packages:

* *BARF* : A multiplatform open source Binary Analysis and Reverse engineering Framework
* *PyAsmJIT* : A JIT for the Intel x86_64 architecture.
* *BARFgadgets* : A tool built upon BARF that lets you *search*, *classifiy* and *verify* ROP gadgets inside a binary program. More information in ``barf/tools/gadgets``.

All packages were tested on Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 (x86_64).
